foreach ($results as $row) {
    $unit_cost = $row['unit_cost'];
    $unit_price = $row['unit_price'];
    $name = $row['name'];
    $product_id = $row['product_id'];
    $desired_quantity = $row['desired_quantity'];
    
    // Check if unit cost matches unit price, with tolerance of 0.01
    if (abs($unit_cost - $unit_price) > 0.01) {
      $diff_percentage = abs($unit_cost - $unit_price) / $unit_price * 100;
      flash("Warning: The unit cost of {$name} (product ID: {$product_id}) in your cart differs from its unit price by {$diff_percentage}%");
